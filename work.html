         <h4 id="gender-gap-tracker">Gender Gap Tracker</h4>
           <p>This project seeks to quantify gender bias in the media by counting the proportion of people quoted in news text who are women. To do so, we developed a system that analyzes articles published online by certain English-language Canadian news outlets, using parts we built in combination with off-the-shelf NLP tools.</p>
           <em>
           <p id="gender-gap-tracker-nb">Nota bene: This project uses gender analysis that has some notable flaws. Although we have three categories of gender—male, female and other—the 'other' category lumps together cases where the speaker's gender is unknown as well as where the speaker's gender is known to fall outside the binary. Furthermore, our system depends on databases that encode binary gender (which erases nonbinary people) and on other NLP systems, e.g., for coreference analysis, that are known to have significant performance gaps for resolving instances of singular they and for English neopronouns (ze/hir, xe/xyr, etc.). We have manual overrides for (famous) people whom we know are systematically misgendered by these systems we depend on, but for most cases, we make probabilistic guesses at a person's gender based on their name - a problematic and cissexist practice. This impacts the accuracy of all reported results and we discuss these ethical considerations and more in our paper (currently under review).</p>
           <p>Gender is fluid and personal, and therefore "gender recognition" as a concept is impossible to do. At the same time, equitable representation in the media is important, and all previous manual attempts at quantifying this gender gap in media quotes have required orders of magnitude more time and labour, while still suffering from many of the same assumptions (e.g., correlating certain names with a gender, assuming pronouns unambiguously tell you someone's gender, etc.). Self-reported gender for speakers quoted in newspaper articles is not information that reporters collect, though this would be how to do this research in a perfect world.</p>
           <p>If you are considering doing similar work or just generally examining gender as a variable, I encourage you to look at the following references: this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/towards-trans-inclusive-ai-a4abe9ad4e62">blog post on trans-inclusive AI</a>, this excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVr8NJwcMH4">talk by Kirby Conrod on How To Do Things With Gender</a>, the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.418/">Cao-Daumé paper on gender-inclusive coreference resolution</a> which includes some great examples and new datasets, and this <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-1601/">paper by Brian Larson on gender as a variable in NLP</a>, informed by the Belmont Report. Look up Kirby Conrod, Os Keyes, Lauren Ackerman and Ártemis López. For gender and facial recognition, read <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3359246">this paper evaluating commercial facial recognition technologies</a>, and this <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274357">Os Keyes paper about the impact of gender recognition using facial analysis on trans folks</a>.</p>

         <h4>TACT: Topic Analysis, Constructiveness and Toxicity</h4>
           <p>This project analyzed millions of online comments on English news articles to examine toxicity, constructiveness, and content in this genre and their interplay. Our results paint a more positive picture of the internet than our lay perceptions because it turns out that moderated comment sections are quite constructive. Our findings yield insights for news outlets to moderate comments and advise commenters, as well as for internet citizens looking to have more meaningful interactions with others online.</p>

         <h4>Adverbly Adjectives</h4>
           <p>This project aimed to create a semantic classification of the [adverb-ly adjective] construction - an adjective modified by an adverb ending in 'ly'. I used R and Python to computationally extract, count and classify instances of these constructions in large corpora (<a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/">COCA</a>, <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/core/">CORE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sfu-discourse-lab/SOCC">SOCC</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/movie%24-data/">CMU Movie$</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/">Cornell movie reviews</a>, <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview">NYT reviews</a>)</p>
